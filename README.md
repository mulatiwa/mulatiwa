# Mulatiwa Mwambwa [Fullstack Software Developer]

As a software developer, the successful design and development of an information system is underpinned by initially splitting the entire system into smaller components, each component is then designed and developed in such a way that individual components are not tightly coupled. The system is then the result of combining these individual components, together with the appropriate technology stack and tooling to create the features of the entire system.
